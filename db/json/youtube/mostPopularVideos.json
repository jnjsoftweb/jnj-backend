Current CrunchLabs founder and friend of science.\n\nAnswers to some common questions:\n\n1) I make a monthly toy we build together on a video, that gets delivered to your house that teaches you to think like an engineer.  Check it out at- https://crunchlabs.com\n2) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.\n3) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I made some Halloween costumes.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years. Then in 2022 I created CrunchLabs to deliver monthly toys that teach you to think like an engineer.\n",
